This project was a hands-on way to introduce you to many new Rust concepts: let, match, functions, the use of external crates, and more. In the next few chapters, youâ€™ll learn about these concepts in more detail. Chapter 3 covers concepts that most programming languages have, such as variables, data types, and functions, and shows how to use them in Rust. 

The program is heavily commented as the official rust documentation.

This code follows the instructions form the [Official Rust Tutorial Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html)
